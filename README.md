# Whose-GIL-is-it-anyway
This is a reimplementation of [The Thought Emporium](https://github.com/thethoughtemporium)'s [Whose Gene is it Anyway](https://github.com/thethoughtemporium/Whose-gene-is-it-anyway) repo in [GIL](https://github.com/CamelCaseCam/CadBerry). I've written a [medium article](https://camelcasecam.medium.com/how-to-make-egg-whites-using-yeast-529075c4000e) to go along with it as a basic GIL tutorial. Below is the readme from the original repo (GIL files are under the same license as the plasmids, but you should be attributing The Thought Emporium):
